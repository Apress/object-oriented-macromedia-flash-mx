<h2>Book Errata<br>5 March 2003<br>Object-Oriented Macromedia Flash MX</h2>

<hr>

<p><b>Page 39</b></p>
<p>The first paragraph on page 39 is misleading. It begins, "This works the same as before, but use the keyword IN..."</p>
<p>Here is a better version of the full paragraph:</p>
<p>"This example is similar to Listing 4-8, but uses the IN keyword (also known as a for-in loop). Like Listing 4-8, the for-in loop reveals all array elements, but unlike Listing 4-8, the for-in loop does not count from the first to last element of the array (as you might expect). Listing 4-9 demonstrates that ActionScript for-in loops count (or iterate) in reverse order. Use for-in loops when you're not concerned about specific iteration order or when you wish to bypass the verbose syntax of traditional for loops."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Page 93</b></p>
<p>The paragraph immediately before the TIP Box on page 93 mentions the car's this.x property and the bus's this.x property. The property values are incorrect. The second sentence in this paragraph should be:</p>
<p>"That's why the car's this.x is 10, but the bus's this.x is 1."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Page 145</b></p>
<p>The first sentence of the NOTE Box on page 145 is confusing. It should be:</p>
<p>"Normally, whenever you drag symbols from the Library to the Stage, you should give the resulting on-screen instance a unique name."</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Page 227</b></p>
<p>The fourth instruction on page 227 reads:</p>
<p class=code>loadClip("Red", "Red", 40, 260);</p>
<p>It should be:</p>
<p>loadClip("Red", "red", 40, 260);</p>
<p>Notice the second parameter "red" is lowercase. User defined variables are not case sensitive in Flash MX, but this change makes the code consistent.</p>
